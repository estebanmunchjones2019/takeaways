# Max's JavaScript course

## 

## Getting started

### Prettier

Add Prettier VScode extension first and use a shortcut to make code look better:

To check the shortcut, go to `Code -> Preferences -> Shortcuts` and then type `format document`. Then check whis is the shortcut. It should be:

`option + shift + F`

### VSCode settings

under `code -> preferences -> settings`, there are `User` (applied to all projects) and `Workspace` applied to the a spesific project.

The `.editorconfig` file in the project is the one managing the workspace settings

### Using incognito mode on VSCode

it helps preventing extensions running extra code on our apps

## Basics: Variables, Data Types, Operators & Functions

how to add JS code to an `html` file?

1) ```html
   <head>
    <script>
        alert('hey, I'm an alert!)
    </script>
   </head>
   ```

the downside: the html gets long an messy with inline JS.

2) ```html
   <head>
       <script src="path-to-the-JS-file"> </script >
   </head>
   ```

IMPORTANT: self closing `<script />` tag is not supported.

IMPORTANT: the above ways, are **BLOCKING** the loading of the HTML. In our case, the html doesnt load till we click on the alert ðŸ˜¯

3) Add the script to the end of the `<body>`:
   
   ```html
   <body>
   Â Â Â Â <script src="path-to-the-JS-file"> </script >
   </body>
   ```

Contact Max, on Chrome, this 3rd option still blocks the html, but it doesnt block it on Firefox.

### The order if JS imports matter

```html
<body>

// this line imports JS that define variables that are DOM elements
<script src="assets/scripts/vendor.js"></script>

// this code will use those DOM elements
<script src="assets/scripts/app.js"></script>


</body>
```

### Declaring variables

A variable can be declared, but not defined, so it becomes a **uninitialized variable**:

```js
let currentResult;
```

and the value is `undefined`.




### Naming variables:

allowed special characters:

1) number, but not at the begining. `let sprint1`, 

2) underscore: `user_name`. Snake case not recommended. Names can still start with `_`

3) `$` like, `let $posts`, like when using observables in Angular;

Don't do:

`let let`, becaus how will JS know which `let` you wanna use in the following piece of code XD.

### 

### Semicolons

are optional in JS, but required in this use case (two expressions in one line):

```js
let variableA; let variableB;
```



### Operators

styntax features that let us manipulate values

#### Mathematical operators

the not known by me are

1) `%` that returns the remainder of dividing two numbers. 

2) `**`Exponentiation, `2**3=8`

#### Assign operator

it's just `=`, we use in the variable definitions, e.g.
