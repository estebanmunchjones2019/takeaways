# React  & TypeScript

## TypeScript Basics & Core concepts

Installing the typescript compiler globally:

````bash
npm i -g typescript

// then run the compiler
tsc

// or run it on demand without installing it
npx tsc

````

VSCode has typescript support, so we'll see error even before running the compiler

First example:
````ts
let animal = 'dog' // a 'string' type was infered here.  Just hover over it and we'll see 'let animal: string'

animal = 1; // ‚ùå Type 'number' is not assignable to type 'string'
````

What if I don't want to initialise the variable with a value? TS fallbacks to 'any' as the type

```ts
let animal; // no inferrance here. Just hover over it and we'll see 'let animal: any'

animal = 1; // no error here
```

````ts
let animal  // no inferrance here. Just hover over it and we'll see 'let animal: any'

animal = 1; // no error
animal = 'dog' // no error
````

What if I want a type and no value assigned to the variable?

```ts
let animal: string // this is and 'explicit type assignment'

animal = 1; // ‚ùå Type 'number' is not assignable to type 'string'
```

Avoid `explicit type assignment` when inference works:

````ts
let animal: string = 'dog' //‚ùådont do that! TS is smart enough in this case
````



### Basic primitive types

string, number and boolean



### Union types

a variable can have more than one type, so we need to write a union to allow ts to compile

````ts
// just declaring a variable 
let user: string | number;

user = 'dog'

user = 123
````

```ts
// or assigning a value
let user string | number = 'cagghrt'
```

### Working with object types

````ts
// all the object fields are required
type User = {
  name: string; // a coma also works instead of semicolon
  age: number;
  isAdmin: boolean;
  id: string | number
}

let user: User;

user = {
  name: 'Esteban',
  age: 34,
  isAdmin: true,
  id: 123 
}
````

### Array types

````ts
type Hobbies = string[] // or Array<string>

let hobbies: Hobbies;

hobbies = ['fishing', 'coding']
````

### Types in  functions

if the function doesn't return anything, a special TS type `void` is inferred.

````
const add = (a: number, b:number)=> { // void is inferred as the returned type
  const number = a + b; // infered as number by TS, really smart
  console.log(number)
}
````

````ts
const add = (a: number, b:number)=> {  // number is inferred as the returned type
  const number = a + b; // infered as number by TS, really smart
  console.log(number)
  return number
}
````

````ts
const add = (a: number, b:number): üëânumber=> {  // ‚ùå unnecessary code
  const number = a + b; // infered as number by TS, really smart
  console.log(number)
  return number
}
````
